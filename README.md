# SF-Mono-Font
This monospaced variant of San Francisco enables alignment between rows and columns of text, and is used in coding environments like Xcode. SF Mono features six weights and supports Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts.

I downloaded the SF Mono font from fontsfree.net. Since the website requires downloading each font in the SF Mono family individually, I downloaded all of them and put them here to save you time.

## Important Notes:

- If you plan to use this font for commercial purposes, you should purchase a license.
- If you're using macOS, it's best to download the official version directly from Apple: Apple Developer Fonts https://developer.apple.com/fonts.
- This version is a TrueType (TTF) font. If you need an OpenType (OTF) version, you can find it on this https://github.com/supercomputra/SF-Mono-Font.
