# SF-Mono-Font
This monospaced variant of San Francisco enables alignment between rows and columns of text, and is used in coding environments like Xcode. SF Mono features six weights and supports Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts.

I downloaded sf mono font from https://fontsfree.net on the web, we have to download each font in SF Mono Family so I downloaded all of them and put them here to reduce download time. Note if you use the font for commercial purposes, you should buy it.
If you use macos, you'd better go to Apple's official website and download it https://developer.apple.com/fonts
